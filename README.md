Code is derived from Demo #3, which displays weather info and the day's calendar.

Would have forked it, but couldn't see it on Seeedstudio's repos.



To do:

Ensure that units are selected automatically (their version was fixed on F & mmHg; this now uses C & mbar)

Ensure that date format is selected automatically 

Change font size for date display so that "Wednesday" does not overlap centre dividing line
(Same for "September", need to test other months too)

Add a battery monitor
